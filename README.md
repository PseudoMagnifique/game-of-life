# Game of Life

Implementation of the game of life in Python.

## Rules

The game takes place in a grid, where every cell can either be alive or dead. You create the initial configuration and each new generation is determined by the following rules:
1. If a cell has 2 alive neighbours, its state remains the same.
2. If a dead cell has 3 alive neighbours, it becomes alive. If the cell was already alive, its state remains the same.
3. If a cell has another amount of alive neighbours, it dies: 0 or 1 by underpopulation, 4 or more by overpopulation.

The neighbours of a cell are the 8 cells around it.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/PseudoMagnifique/game-of-life`
2. Launch `main.py` with `python3 path/to/main.py n m`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` of columns of the grid. The grid is 20x20 if no $n$ and $m$ parameters are specified.
3. Using your keyboard arrows to move from one cell to another, tap `x` to make a dead cell alive or kill a living cell.
4. Once you're done and satisfied with the initial configuration, tap `<Enter>` and watch the game unfold.
